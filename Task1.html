            <h2>
                <p>I am Dominic Tochi Emmanuel,
            </h2> I was born on December 12, 1997 in Owerri, Imo State. We are five siblings in
            the family and I'm the middle child. My parents, Mr Patrick Dominic a retired <abbr
                title="Power Holding Company of Nigeria">PHCN</abbr> staff and Mrs Perpetua
            Dominic a nurse, were both born and raised in Imo State. My childhood was a fun one with strips to the
            village
            every Christmas, with cousins coming back from different partys of the country and outside of Nigeria too.
            </p>
            <p>My nursery and primary education spanned out in three different schools, but finally I obtained my first
                school leaving certificate at St. Bartholomew Nursery and Primary School, Phase 2, Site 2 Kubwa in
                Abuja.
                My secondary education quite like my primary education spanned out in three different schools. I
                obtained my
                <abbr title="Senior School Certificate Examination">SSCE</abbr> at the prestigious Government Secondary
                School Owerri. In 2016, I gained admission into the Federal University of Technology Owerri(FUTO), where
                I
                studied Mechanical Engineering. It was a five year course, but due to the incessant strike actions by
                <abbr title="Academic Staff Union of Universities">ASUU</abbr>, I ended up graduating in December of
                2022. I
                am currently waiting to be called up by the <abbr title="National Youth Service Corp">NYSC</abbr> to
                serve
                my country.
            </p>
            <p>While I've been waiting for services, I entered a four week internship on frontend development which was
                organised by SideHustle. I am currently enrolled in another software programming and development class,
                organised by TIIDELab.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my favorite things to do are watching football(I'm a die hard Manchester United fan), movies,
                reading novels and listening to good music too. With help of SideHustle and TIIDELab, I hope to make
                coding
                one of my favorite things also.
            </p>
